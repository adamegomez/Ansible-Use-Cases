## 🔧 Project Scope

### Agentless Architecture
- Communicates via SSH — no agents required
- Simplifies deployment and reduces overhead

### YAML Playbooks & Modules
- Playbooks define automation tasks in YAML
- Modules used:  
  - `pip`: Manages Python dependencies  
  - `openssh_cert`: Generates OpenSSH certificates  
  - `oci_vn`: Oracle Cloud virtual networking

### Inventory & Playbook Structure
- **Inventory file**: Defines target hosts/groups
- **Tasks**: Individual actions within playbooks
- **Roles**: Reusable bundles of tasks

### Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
- Centralized Web UI with RBAC and Analytics
- Enterprise-ready automation at scale

---

## 📈 Use Cases
- ✅ Configuration Management
- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Automation
- ✅ Cloud Provisioning (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- ✅ Security Enforcement (firewalls, policies)
- ✅ Network Device Configuration

---

## 🔐 Security Practices
- SSH Key Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Full logging for traceability and accountability
- Prevents unauthorized changes to systems

## ⚖️ Advantages & Disadvantages

| ✅ Advantages | ❌ Disadvantages |
|--------------|------------------|
| Agentless (uses SSH) | Learning curve for advanced YAML use |
| Simple YAML syntax | Limited Windows support |
| Scales well across Linux systems | Performance degradation at massive scale |
| Strong community support (Galaxy) | Heavy SSH dependency |
| RBAC & auditing tools | AAP requires paid subscription |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Ansible is a powerful, agentless IT automation tool that simplifies tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and cloud orchestration. With its simple syntax, robust community, and enterprise-grade options (like AAP
